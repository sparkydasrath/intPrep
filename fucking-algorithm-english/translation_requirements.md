Thank you all for your participation in the translation!

please clone newest `english` branch, please see [closed pull request](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) Make sure that the article you are translating is currently not available in English.

After the translation is completed, please delete the public account QR code at the end of the text. For the first translated version submitted, you can add authors and translators below the first level heading at the beginning of the article:

**Translator: [YourName](https://github.com/YourName)**

**Author: [labuladong](https://github.com/labuladong)**

Your link can point you wherever you want.
### Translation convention

1、The translation must be smooth and consistent with the English grammar. Basic technical terms such as Queue, stack, binary tree, etc. should be used correctly. Misuse of such words can be confusing. For Chinese that is not easy to translate, you can modify it according to your understanding. **After translation, be sure to check the basic grammar with a tool, such as pasting your English text into Word to see if there are any basic grammatical errors **.

2、**All content should be subject to the `master` branch**, because the` english` branch is only for translation and will not update the article. So if you find that an article in the `master` does not exist or conflicts in the` english` branch, translate it based on the md file in the `master` branch. Do n’t forget to add the relevant picture folder to` english `Branch.

3、**Boldness and other information need to be retained, while encouraging the expansion of your own knowledge**, adding references, adding important knowledge points in bold or using English (or other languages) unique forms of expression to express certain ideas.

4. For pictures, Chinese characters are rarely included. If it does not affect understanding, such as the public number watermark in the lower right corner of the picture, you do not need to modify it.**If the Chinese character involves algorithmic understanding, you need to modify the picture together**, erase the Chinese character and replace it with English, or if there are few Chinese characters, add the corresponding English beside the Chinese characters. **For some pictures that describe the topic**, they are all the pictures I took on the Chinese version of LeetCode. You can go to the English version of LeetCode to find the corresponding topic screenshot replacement. If you do n’t know which question, you can leave a message in the issue and I will give You look for. The original Chinese md file needs to be deleted.

5. **Keep the original directory structure, but the names of files and folders should be changed to English**. The name of the md file should be modified to the appropriate English according to the content of the specific article (files should not include spaces), the pictures cited in the article The path sometimes also contains Chinese, you need to change the folder containing the picture to appropriate English. **After the translation is complete, you need to delete the md file in the original Chinese**. If you added an English version of the picture, you should also delete the original Chinese picture.

6. **Only process the articles (and related pictures) agreed in the issue, and do not move any other content**, otherwise conflicts will easily occur when you submit results to the main repository in the future. If there is a conflict, you need to find a way to use Git tools to resolve the version conflict between the local repository and the main repository before you can submit a pull request. It is very important to practice using Git.

In fact, none of the algorithmic questions we brush up have any special English words, and many of the crooked nuts are not necessarily English. Google Translator's translation of articles with a bit of terms (stack, queue, etc.) is very poor, and even the code translates for you, so don't be afraid to turn it bravely, we will gradually improve in iterations ~

PS: Again, don't modify the articles other than those agreed in the issue, so that your pr will not conflict. Committing your branch also requires committing to the `english` branch. Do not submit any changes to the` master` branch.
